This variation of a bivariate area chart uses clipping to alternate colors. When New York is 
warmer than San Francisco, the difference between the two is filled in green. When San Francisco 
is warmer, the difference is filled in red. A similar technique was used by William Playfair all 
the way back in 1786.
